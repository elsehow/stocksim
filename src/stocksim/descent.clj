(ns stocksim.descent
  "Contains API functions for performing gradient descent on pure
  functions using gradient optimisers.

  The basic function used for instrumented gradient descent is 'study'.
  It takes a function, an optimiser, an initial parameter vector,
  and a termination function. Termination functions are simply functions
  that are called with a data structure to determine whether or not to
  stop, but it is most convenient to use the 'term' macro to construct
  termination functions as compositions of the termination function
  transformations defined in this namespace.

  Here is how you can run gradient descent until the magnitude of the
  gradient drops below a certain quantity.

  To explore the behavior of gradient descent on a particular function,
  you can use 'interactive' instead of 'study', which will allow you to
  select the size of each step, among other features. Make sure to call
  (emacs) first, if you are running your REPL inside Emacs.

  Returning to 'study', you can use additional termination function
  transformations to output information about the gradient descent,
  such as the parameter vector at each step.

  This next example will wait one second before each step, and stop
  after five steps. By swapping the order of 'slow-steps' and
  'outputf', you can cause the printing to happen after the
  one-second delay, instead of before. Notice that six vectors are
  printed -- this is because the termination function is also called
  before the initial step is taken, with the initial parameter vector.

  Using the 'pause' transformation, you can view steps in groups of a
  specified size, instead of all at once. You can change the group
  size during the run, and stop when you wish.

  Each blank line represents a line read from stdin. (Remember to call
  (emacs) if your REPL is running within Emacs.) The first group of
  lines printed has three lines, not two, because of the initial step.
  After that, two-line groups are printed until the user switches to
  three-line groups.

  You can use various tricks to help avoid printing long vectors. For
  instance, 'do-study' is the same as 'study', but it returns nil instead
  of the last parameter vector. Also, you can pass vectors and functions
  to outputf, which allow you to display only the magnitude of vectors.
  Note that the :last-step will be nil on the initial step, so you have
  to check that you are not on the initial step before trying to take its
  magnitude. Alternatively, you could add ':in skip-initial' to the
  beginning of the argument list to 'term', which would skip the initial
  step for all transformations further down the pipeline. Using ':in'
  instead of ':out' specifies that the 'skip-initial' transformation
  is a transformation on the *argument* to the termination function,
  rather than a transformation on the *output* of the function.

  Following is an extremely complicated example. It serves mostly to
  illustrate just how extensible the termination function
  transformations can be when pushed to their limit. The purpose of
  the example is to investigate the oscillations exhibited by ADADELTA
  when it approaches a minimum. First is displayed the oscillation
  vector, which is defined as the ratio between successive
  gradients. This will be less than one when the gradient is
  shrinking, greater than one when it is growing, and negative when
  oscillations are occurring. On the far right-hand side, the number of
  consecutive steps with oscillations is shown, as well as the text
  '[OSCILLATION]' when this number if non-zero -- to make it easier to
  notice.

  Here is one way to look at the full map passed to the termination
  function. Since this is a fairly nonstandard thing, we define
  a termination function transformation inline. After calling the
  original termination function, it pretty-prints the state map.
  Notice that some values are marked as <unrealized> in the printed
  map. This is because the returned map is lazy. To avoid forcing
  the lazy map when we pretty-print it, we have to use the
  lazy map pprint dispatch function defined in util. (Of course,
  if you want to see everything, you can just pprint it, with no
  special dispatch, but computing e.g. the function value might
  take a long time, which is why the map is lazy in the first
  place.)

(defn interactive
  "Performs interactive gradient descent. The interactive part is
  that before each step, you will be prompted for the learning rate.
  (If :normalize? is falsy, though, the gradient vector will be
  normalized before multiplying it by the learning rate -- so in this
  case, you are specifying the step size rather than the learning rate.)
  You can enter the learning rate in any format accepted by
  Double/parseDouble, and it can even be negative (although you would
  then be performing gradient *ascent* rather than descent). If you
  don't specify a learning rate, the last one you entered is used again.
  (But you cannot do this on the first step, because there is not any
  previous entry at that point.) By default, a step will be aborted if
  it would increase the value of the objective function, but you can
  override this behavior by starting your entry with 'force' (as in
  'force 1', or just 'force' -- the latter version would reuse your
  last entered learning rate). A complete history of past steps is
  kept, and every input you make (even if the step is aborted)
  corresponds to an entry in the history. You can revert to previous
  entries in the history by typing 'back 5' (to go back five entries)
  or just 'back' (to go back one entry). Note that the 'previously
  entered step' is determined by the history, so if you go to a previous
  state in the history and then take a step without providing a learning
  rate, the learning rate used will be the last one entered *before that
  point in the history*, not the last one that you literally entered
  in real life. You can customize the prompt by passing a new string for
  :prompt; this string will be passed to util/sformat with the function
  value and gradient as positional arguments."

(defmacro term
  "Constructs a termination function from a collection of transformations.
  Each transformation is a higher-order function that takes a termination
  function (and optionally some additional parameters) and returns another
  termination function. To make it easy to reason about the order in
  which transformations are applied, transformations are grouped into
  two types: 'in' and 'out'. Conceptually, 'in' transformations modify the
  argument passed to the termination function before calling the original
  function; 'out' transformations call the original termination function,
  optionally cause side effects, and optionally modify the return value.

  The syntax for labels+transforms is as follows. Each element must be
  either a transformation function or one of the keywords :in or :out.
  Whether a transformation function is treated as an 'in' or an 'out'
  transformation is determined by looking at the last keyword specified
  in the argument vector. It is an error to specify a transformation as
  the first argument, since it cannot be determined which type the
  transformation is meant to be.

  The threading order of the transformations is designed to be as intuitive
  as possible. That is, provided that standard transformation functions are
  used, when the final termination function is called, first each of the
  'in' transformations are applied to its argument, from left to right,
  then each of the 'out' labels take effect, with the order of the side
  effects being from left to right and the rightmost modifications to the
  return value being last.

  This macro expands into a call to the single-arrow threading macro (->),
  so you can provide additional arguments to transformation functions by
  wrapping them in lists, just like with regular -> calls.

  If you create additional transformation functions, be sure to conform to
  the interface expected by this macro, which is as follows:

  - 'in' transformations should transform the argument, call the original
    termination function with the transformed argument, and return whatever
    is returned by original termination function.
  - 'out' transforms should call the original termination function with the
    given argument, and then terminate if the original termination function
    returns truthy. If the original termination function returns falsy,
    then they should perform any side effects, and return the possibly
    transformed or overridden return value.

  This will provide a consistent user experience at the REPL."
